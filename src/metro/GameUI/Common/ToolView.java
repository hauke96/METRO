/**
 * A class extending the ToolView is a game component (not a pure UI component) using to easily embed - sometimes complex - tools into others.
 * A ToolView doesn't necessarily has to have a UI component. It is just a component able to interact with the whole screen. 
 * 
 * The ToolView is also used to create stages in the application.
 * E.g. could a {@code MainMenu} be such a sage, where the user can move to the {@code MainView} view, showing the normal game.
